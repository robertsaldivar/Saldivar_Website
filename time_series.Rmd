Time series data wrangling and visualization

```{r}
#loading the packages that I think that I will need for this time series analysis

#Packages for general use:
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(here)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(knitr)

#Packages for time series use:
library(tsibble)
library(fable)
library(fabletools)
library(feasts)

# Reading in the data that will be analyzed:
steelhead_passage <- read_csv(here("data", "cbr_fish_passage_bonneville_allyrs_steelhead.csv")) 
```



1. Summary of the project.
The data for this project is from Columbia Basin Research, which measured the number of Steelhead passing through the Bonneville Dam. The analysis in this markdown down document summarizes the daily, monthly, and annual number of steelhead passing through the Bonneville Dam. 

2. Images of Bonneville Dam and/or steelhead

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bonneville-dam-and-people-fishing.jpg")

3. code

```{r}
# This code chunk is going to parse and arrange the dates in the data so that it can be separated by months individually and a single column with all of the elements of a date. I am also making sure that each part of the date is treated like a date in R's brain.

steelhead_date <- steelhead_passage %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  separate(mm_dd, c("day", "month"))

steelhead_date$date <- paste(steelhead_date$year, steelhead_date$month, steelhead_date$day, sep = "-") %>%
  ymd() %>%
  as.Date()

steelhead_parsed <- steelhead_date %>%
  mutate(month = month(date, label = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(month_sep = yearmonth(date)) %>%
  drop_na()


```


```{r}
#This code chunk is going to create a time series plot of daily observation of steelhead passing through the dam.

steelhead_daily_plot <- ggplot(data = steelhead_parsed, aes(x = date, y = value)) +
  geom_line() + #This is the base code to create the graph, now I am going to make the graph look nice

Figure 2. The Daily Steelhead Passage Through Bonneville Dam. The daily passage is faily consistent from 1940 to 2000. After 2000 it the the daily passage appears to increase.
